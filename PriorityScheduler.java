/**
 * A scheduler that chooses threads based on their priorities.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * A priority scheduler associates a priority with each thread. The next thread
 * to be dequeued is always a thread with priority no less than any other
 * waiting thread's priority. Like a round-robin scheduler, the thread that is
 * dequeued is, among all the threads of the same (highest) priority, the
 * thread that has been waiting longest.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * Essentially, a priority scheduler gives access in a round-robin fassion to
 * all the highest-priority threads, and ignores all other threads. This has
 * the potential to
 * starve a thread if there's always a thread waiting with higher priority.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * A priority scheduler must partially solve the priority inversion problem; in
 * particular, priority must be donated through locks,` and through joins.
